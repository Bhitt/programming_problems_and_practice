Java implementation

Note: decided not to solve this with a stack since I already knew that solution
from formal languages class.

76 / 76 test cases passed.
Status: Accepted
Runtime: 81 ms
Memory Usage: 37.4 MB

Runtime: 81 ms, faster than 5.08% of Java online submissions for Valid Parentheses.
Memory Usage: 37.4 MB, less than 5.06% of Java online submissions for Valid Parentheses.

Note: this method would be much faster if implemented in python since string operations
are very slow in java.
